Since 2009 Stillwater Consulting has been helping fire departments modernize firefighter training through the application of e-learning technology designed around their unique needs and standards. Our FLMS online learning platform has been designed by fire service instructors to provide capabilities unique to the needs of the fire service. Cost effectiveness and customizable content are key drivers of our philosophy of ongoing development and improvement as new challenges arise.  Our platform approach ensures training content can be updated over time and made available to every member of the fire department as training material and requirements evolve over time.
